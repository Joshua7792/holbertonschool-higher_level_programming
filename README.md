- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
- `100-print_tebahpla.py`: A script that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- `101-remove_char_at.py`: A function that removes a character at a given position from a string.
- `101-main.py`: A script that tests the `101-remove_char_at.py` function.
- `11-main.py`: A script that tests the `11-pow.py` function.
- `10-main.py`: A script that tests the `10-add.py` function.
- `9-main.py`: A script that tests the `9-print_last_digit.py` function.
- `8-main.py`: A script that tests the `8-uppercase.py` function.
- `7-main.py`: A script that tests the `7-islower.py` function.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that tests the `6-print_comb3.py` script.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A script that tests the `5-print_comb2.py` script.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that tests the `4-print_hexa.py` script.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A script that tests the `3-print_alphabt.py` script.

Note that the `__pycache__/` directory contains compiled bytecode files that Python generates to improve the performance of importing modules. You can safely ignore this directory.

# python-import_modules

- `2-args.py`: A script that prints the arguments passed to it using the `sys` module.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: A script that adds any number of positive integers passed to it as arguments.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: A script that prints all the names defined in a module that do not start with "\_\_".
- `5-variable_load.py`: A script that imports a variable from a module and prints its value.
- `100-my_calculator.py`: A script that imports all functions from a module and uses them to perform various calculations.
- `101-easy_print.py`: A script that prints a specific string to the console using the `sys` module.
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: A Python function that replicates the following Python bytecode:

```
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              9 BINARY_POWER
