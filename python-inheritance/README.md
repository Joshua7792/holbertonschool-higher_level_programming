# Python Inheritance and Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains Python scripts and classes that showcase concepts related to object-oriented programming and inheritance in Python.

## Contents

The project is organized into various tasks and files, each addressing different aspects of Python programming. Here's an overview:

### Task 0: Lookup

- Implement a function that returns a list of available attributes and methods of an object.

### Task 1: My List

- Create a class `MyList` that inherits from the `list` class.
- Implement a method `print_sorted` that prints the list in ascending order.

### Task 2: Exact Same Object

- Write a function that determines if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.

### Task 3: Same Class or Inherit From

- Implement a function to check if an object is an instance of a specified class or inherits from it.

### Task 4: Only Sub Class Of

- Write a function to check if an object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class.

### Task 5: Geometry Module

- Create an empty class `BaseGeometry`.

### Task 6: Improve Geometry

- Enhance the `BaseGeometry` class by adding a method `area` that raises an exception with a message.

### Task 7: Integer Validator

- Extend the `BaseGeometry` class to include an `integer_validator` method for value validation.
- It raises exceptions if the value is not an integer or is less than or equal to 0.

### Task 8: Rectangle

- Define a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry`.
- Implement instantiation with width and height.
- Ensure width and height are private and positive integers.

### Task 9: Full Rectangle

- Enhance the `Rectangle` class by implementing the `area` method.
- Make `print` and `str` methods display a description of the rectangle.

### Task 10: Square #1

- Create a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`.
- Implement instantiation with size and an area method.

### Task 11: Square #2

- Extend the `Square` class to have a custom `print` and `str` method for displaying square descriptions.

## Usage

You can use these Python scripts and classes to explore and understand object-oriented programming, inheritance, and class hierarchies in Python. Simply run the scripts to see how they work and experiment with them.
